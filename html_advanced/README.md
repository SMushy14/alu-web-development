HTML, Advanced!
In this project, I implemented a from scratch webpage from a designer file focusing on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantics.
This webpage consists of two parts, like every other html webpage, with the <head> and <body>.
The body is divided into the header, main, and footer.
The <header> part consists of menu links and the school page logo.
The main part is divided into three sections: main_part, testimonials, tutorials, free_mebership, and FAQ.
The footer consists of the school logo and the links to social media.
