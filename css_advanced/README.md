This project follows HTML and is an advanced project. For this project, I focused on the CSS and the style of the page. Styling this page, I used the Figma file to get the exact look of the prototype from Figma. I used as simple CSS elements as possible while achieving the same appearance as the webpage in Figma.
For the header, I used elements like color and positioning to get the menu and logo in the correct positions with the proper color of the text.
For the main part, I used an image as background, width, and length to make the background image fit entirely and in the right place.
I used the span element to make sure the color of some words in a sentence is the correct color as the sample webpage.
I aligned the object's center, and for the button, I used border-radius to round the corners of the button.
I assigned font style as italics for some objects, like the paragraphs in the testimonials section.
Opacity element was used to make the texts in the F.A.Q. section and the footer to make them look faded.
